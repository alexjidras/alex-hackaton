Here is a list of frequently asked questions and answers to them:

Question: I can't remember my password?
Answer: Have you tried clicking on the forgot password link on the login screen? I would recommend doing this so that you are then sent a link to your email to reset your password. I would also recommend verifying that you are using the correct user name. 

Question: How do i reset a resident's password?
Answer: To reset a resident’s password, click on the resident’s name from the main dashboard.  Then under their profile picture, click on Account Information. You will then see a password field and a confirm password field. Enter a password, click on submit in the bottom right hand corner, and share that password with the resident.

Question: How do i discharge a resident in Caremerge ?
Answer: Go to the resident’s profile, click on the “Transition Timeline” which you will find located on the left hand side under the heading labeled “Personal Info” or you can click on the resident’s “Current Status” which is located at the top of the personal information box. Then Click on the green “Add transition” button. Then select “Discharge“ for the status. Choose a date and time and fill out the corresponding boxes. For diagnosis, if it’s not relevant,  just choose “other”. Feel free to make any notes if you like in the comments and notes box. Click on submit

Question: How do i download the staff app ?
Answer: If you have an iOS device, you can easily download the staff app. Go to the app store on your device and search for Caremerge Staff app.  Then click on GET to download the app.

Question: How do i chnage an admission date ?
Answer: When you have the residents profile pulled up, you can click on the current status that is stated in blue at the top left hand corner of the screen. If you scroll down to the very bottom of the transitions timeline, you will see the original admission date in green. If you click on where it says “admitted to community“ that will bring you to another screen and you can change the date there.

Question: How do i delete a duplicate resident?
Answer: There is no way to delete residents so we recommend that you discharge one of the duplicate residents profiles. You can do this by going to that profile and selecting the  “Transition Timeline” which is located under the personal info heading on the left hand side of your screen. 
* I would also suggest changing the resident’s first and last name to “Duplicate” “Duplicate” in their profile. This will help to prevent any confusion in the future.
* Also, within the discharge transition, in the notes/comment section at the bottom, you can make a note that this resident was entered in error and is a duplicate entry.

Questions related to Family Engagement:

Question: How do I send out an invite to a family member?
Answer: When in the resident’s profile, under the Personal Info heading on the left hand side, you will see a tab called Authorized Contacts. Click here, and then click on edit beside the family member’s name. There will be a blue link in the bottom right hand corner. It will either state “Send Invite” or “Resend Expired Invite” Click the link and the family member will receive the invite via email. Please note that in order to send an invite out, that family member must have an email address under that profile.

Question: Am I able to send out more than one invite at a time to different family members?
Answer: Yes, you sure can! When you are on the main resident dashboard, please hover your mouse over the Dashboard  link in the upper right hand corner and you will see Family Dashboard.  Click on the Family dashboard, and then click on the Send Invite link. Here you can check off as many family members as needed and then click on the green Invite button in the upper right hand corner.

Question: Can I send out one message to all family members without having to send them all individually?
Answer: Yes, you can send out one message to all family members by using the  Family Announcements feature. You can do this by clicking on the Family Announcement link that is located under the “My Caremerge” section located in the upper left hand corner when logged into the main resident dashboard. Key thing to remember here is that the family member will have to be signed up for Family Engagement in order to receive the announcement.

Question: How can I tell if a family member accepted the invite I sent?
Answer: At the top of the dashboard, you will see a link labeled “Intelligence” please click that link. You will now be brought to all of our reports. There is a heading labeled “Family” Here you can find all the reports for Family Engagement. The first one is the Family Invite Report. This report will show you the date the family member signed up. You can also do a quick check by going to the resident’s profile -> authorized contacts -> and if that family member has a green check mark by their name they have successfully created an account.
